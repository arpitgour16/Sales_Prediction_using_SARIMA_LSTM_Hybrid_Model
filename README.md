# Sales_Prediction_using_SARIMA_LSTM_Hybrid_Model
Implemented a hybrid SARIMA-LSTM model for accurate sales prediction, combining time series analysis and deep learning techniques to enhance forecasting precision. This approach leverages the strengths of both SARIMA and LSTM models, enabling more robust predictions by capturing both temporal patterns and complex dependencies within the sales data.
Sales analysis is important for any working industry. It helps them to keep a record and predict the sales in near future. In this project, a public data-set which includes the sales history of 4 years of a retail store is investigated to forecast the sales of furniture which is showing seasonality in its trend. To this aim, several forecasting models are applied. First, a conventional SARIMA model is applied. Then a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is applied. Then the data is decomposed into the seasonal and non-seasonal parts and a SARIMA-LSTM HYBRID model is applied to predict the future sales. The performances of the models are compared using RMSE and MAE.
